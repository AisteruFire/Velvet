Velvet adds new functionalities to derpibooru.org. How nice !

QUICK TAGS
Tired of always having to copy/paste the same tags on every artist's page ? Velvet offers a quick tag button, allowing you to insert in a snap your favorite tags in the query.

ALIASES
You have other tags you often use ? You can set aliases to help you in the search field ! They work the same way aliases work in programmation languages : you set a name and what it corresponds to, and you're done !

NEW ! A WILD DITTO OPERATOR APPEARED !
You often use the same query, but sometimes with AND operators, sometimes with OR ? Don't want to write two aliases for this ? Fret not ! The ditto operator is here ! With the help of this little guy, you can make two aliases in one ! When you type your query, just signal to Velvet which operator to use instead of ditto with the help of a customizable flag, and there you go, fresh and shiny !

SETTINGS BUILT IN WEBSITE
To blend herself in a little more, Velvet's settings can be found directly in derpibooru's ! She inserts herself sneakily, as if she was part of the website !

MORE TO COME...?
If suggestions and complaints are made, Velvet will probably evolve with some new and/or better functionnalities ! Who doesn't love improvements ?
